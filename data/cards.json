  "You're lost overnight on a deserted hiking trail",
  "Your car stalls on a narrow mountain road",
  "You wake up in a strange city with no ID, wallet, or phone",
  "A sudden snowstorm strands you on a highway with limited supplies",
  "You and a friend are trapped in an elevator that begins to smoke",
  "Your group is stranded at sea after a small boat capsizes",
  "You're bitten by an unknown insect on a remote island",
  "A forest fire is approaching while you're camping with a tent",
  "Your airplane makes an emergency landing in a desert",
  "You fall through thin ice onto a freezing lake"
