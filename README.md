# Worst-Case Scenario Polished â€” Docker + Tailwind

## Running with Docker (recommended)
1. docker-compose up --build
2. Access client at http://localhost:3000
3. Server runs on http://localhost:4000
4. Stop: docker-compose down

## Manual Dev
### Server
cd server
npm install
npm run dev

### Client
cd client
npm install
npm start

## Multiplayer
- Multiple tabs/devices allowed.
- Each player gets random avatar.
- Chat, scoring, basic game flow.
- Tailwind UI already applied.
